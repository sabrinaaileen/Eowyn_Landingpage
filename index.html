        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I love my family, I love my country and I love our people. But I
          always figured there is more for me outside of Rohan. First, I
          figured, that I was in love with the throne heir of Gondor, Aragorn,
          but that was not it. My uncle always wanted to protect me and so I
          chose to go with him to war. Not just because I know how to use a
          sword, but also to fight for my beloved ones and to protect them.
          <br />
          <br />
          And then, there was the fight. And of course, it was so scary and the
          masses of orcs and other enemies were intimitating. But I took a deep
          breath and went with it. I fought for my life and the lives of my
          family. I even defeated an olifant. But then... there was the witch
          king of Angmar. A horrifying bastard. And he was about to kill my
          uncle! So I gathered all of my courage and stood between the

            >bastard and my uncle</a
          >.
          <br />
          <br />
          Of course I married someone I loved and of course I stayed true to
          myself. But I gave up the dream of glory in battle and devoted my life
          to peace. But sometimes, I wish for more.
          <br />

            strong and I choose to do what knowone expects from me, I learn to
            code. And I will be good. Because if I want to, I can do everything.
            So can you.</b

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          You may already noticed, but of course this site was not coded by the
          lovely Éowyn. But I wanted to honor her. Because I admire her. For me
          she is a role model, definitly. She didn't let the rejection of her
          beloved get her down. She got stronger and fought for what she
          believes in. And that is something important. To not give up on
          yourself and your dreams. And then you are able to defeat the witch
          king (or something less life-threatening).
          <br />
          <br />
          So I put my skills together and created this site. Please enjoy and
          find the little secret gimmicks.

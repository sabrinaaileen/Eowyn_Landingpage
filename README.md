# Éowyn Landing Page 🛡️

A fan-based learning project — built as part of a Codecademy course to practice HTML, CSS, and layout structure.  
I chose Éowyn from *The Lord of the Rings* because I admire her as a strong and inspiring character.

## ✨ What's this about?

This website is a **coding practice project** — not commercial — where I playfully combine fantasy themes with what I’ve learned so far in front-end development.

It includes two HTML pages: `index.html` and `coding.html`.

## 🧭 Page Structure

### 🏠 `index.html`

- **Header**: Background image created with AI, presenting Éowyn as a shieldmaiden  
- **About Me**: A short, poetic interpretation of Éowyn’s character  
- **Projects**: Overview of my coding projects  
  - JavaScript Playground  
  - Two weather apps (vanilla JS & React)  
  - Link to my [portfolio website](https://www.sabrina-aileen-hodapp.de)  
- **Skills**: A list of my own developer skills (not Éowyn’s 😉), with a hand-drawn palm illustration  
- **Footer**: Contact options (email, Instagram) and a disclaimer: This is a **learning project only**

### 💻 `coding.html`

- **"Forgive Me"**: A tongue-in-cheek apology for pretending Éowyn coded the site  
- **Contact Links**: Email, Instagram, Facebook, Castforward (with icons)  
- **Tolkien Quote Section**: Hidden clickable quote from *Return of the King* (Pippin & Gandalf scene) — can you find it?

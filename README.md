#Éowyn Landingpage

index.html

## What's it about?

It's a practice website for a course on Codecademy. I chose to use a fantasy figure I admire, to show what I learned so far.

I started with a header with a background-image I created with help of AI. It should show another view on her and that she is a Shieldmaiden.

### First section: About me

It is a little story about Éowyn, very short and with a lot of interpretation and thoughts of my own

### Second section: My projects

Maybe the heading can do something, try to figure it out. This shows a little overview of my coding projects.

- My latest one: JS Playground with a link to click on
- My weather apps, also with links: My first one and the second one created with react.js
- A link to my website, because there are more links to my projects hosted on Netlify

### Third section: Skills

I reveal that I coded that site and not Éowyn and list all my skills. At the bottom I added the link to my website once more and a picture of a palm I drew. Maybe the palm can do something.

### Footer

I added the footer on both pages. It offers a quick contact via email or Instagram and another link to the contact page. I also write about who I am and what the purpose of this site is: Learn to code and get better. I write also that this site is for learning purposes only and not for commercial purposes.

### First section: Forgive me

An apology. It's because I started on this site in the header with the claim it was again Éowyn, who coded that site. But of course it was me.

### Second section: The ways of contact

I added Icons with links to click on for email, instagram, facebook and castforward

### Third section: I didn't think it would end this way

This section is about a scene from lord of the rings: the return of the king. Pippin and Gandalf are in Minas Tirith and it doesn't look good. The orcs are nearly breaking through the gate. Pippin is afraid of the death and Gandalf was able to take that fear away. Find the right point, you can click to see the rest of the dialogue.

## Conclusion

I wish you fun and good luck to find the little gimmicks.
